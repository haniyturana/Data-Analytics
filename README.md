# Data Analytics & Forecasting Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analytics portfolio. This repository focuses on **Advanced Time Series Forecasting** and **Statistical Analysis**.

### Objective
To predict future trends and derive actionable insights by combining **traditional statistical methods** with **modern machine learning** approaches.

### Key Techniques & Models
I utilize a diverse range of algorithms to handle different data patterns (multiple seasonality, non-linear trends, etc.):
* **Machine Learning:** **XGBoost** (Gradient Boosting for regression-based forecasting).
* **Modern Forecasting:** **Prophet** (Robust to missing data & outliers).
* **Statistical Models:** **TBATS** (Complex/Multi-seasonal data), **ARIMA/SARIMA**.
* **Analysis:** Seasonality Decomposition, Hypothesis Testing.

### Why R for this Portfolio?
R is my tool of choice here because of its unrivaled ecosystem for Time Series. It allows me to seamlessly benchmark traditional models (like TBATS) against modern ML wrappers, ensuring the most accurate model is selected for the specific dataset.
